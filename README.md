# drone
As part of my Independent Work for Completion of my masters degree in NUS ISS , I work on Autonomous smart drone which will have smart features and capacity to take basic decisions without handler input.

**--------**

Here main focus is mainly on below points:
* Human detection
* Track detected human
* Point drone to follow tracker
* Hallway Navigation:
 * Vanishing point rectification
 * Point drone towards calculated point.
* Hardware Features:
 * 3D printed multicoptor
 * containers for holding Raspberry Pi + Pixhawk FC and other sensors.
 * Anti vibration pad or device which will bring down jello effect in camera.


Any other features if added will be updated over time
