This Folder is for Vanishing point based navigation of drone.

It contains 2 files:

1: VanishingPoint.py which contains all the functions defined in it for detecting lines and intersection and finding grid with max intersection.
2: Main.py  -  Python code which will call previos functions and utilize it for movement of drone.

Code is working condition but detail for movement will be updated.
